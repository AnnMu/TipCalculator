# TipCalculator

## About the web application

This is my final project for [Harvard CS50x](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/) course. It's a website named *“Tip Calculator”* that serves as a way to calculate your personal share of the tip given in a certain restaurant. 

It is based on the amount of a restaurant bill, considers an additional tip based on the quality of the service and then respects the number of people sharing the bill to calculate everyone's share of the tip. It assumes an even spread of the tip amount. 

The bill amount, the percentage tip or service quality and the number of people sharing the bill are the three input variables necessary to calculate each dining member's tip share. 

The calculating mechanism is written in a Java Script file while the stile of the web appication is writtten in a CSS file.
